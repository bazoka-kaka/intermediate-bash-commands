# Piping Out into Commands

in the terminal, we bassically work with three types of data:

1. standard output (stdout)
2. standard input (stdin)
   <br>
   example:
   ```
   cat bash.md | grep -w 'command'
   ```
3. standard error (stderr)

### note

the grep tool is just bassically a searching tool
