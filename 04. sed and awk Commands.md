# sed and awk Commands

These commands are oftenly getting confused with grep
because they are very similar to grep
<br>
awk is a complete programming language
<br>
as new programming languages come like python or pearl
which are superior to awk which is a complete programming language,
it gets really "useless" that we have these better scripting languages.
there are certain situations where these tools can be used effectively

## why using these two commands?

sed is a text stream editor
that is bassically gonna look through each line of a document
and on each line, it's gonna look for by character.
<br>
This is great for simple text transformation
for example if you wanna change comma with dots
you can do that using sed
<br>

but if you wanna do logics and do more complex stuffs
to do these replacements or something else, then you can use awk.
<br>
awk is not a stream editor, it's more like a text editor
where you can go line by line and you can split each line into
delimited fields also you can specify which fields to delimit by.
for example, if you document has spaces, then you can add space delimiter
then you can have access to each words within particular line.
<br>
awk is great for reformatting a bunch of text like printing it out
into a nice output for you to see or also some more complex text
transformation or formatting transformations.
<br>
don't confuse these with grep because grep is just a text searching tool.
there's no replacing things within this output

## example of using sed

common syntax:

```
> sed 's/regexp/replace/g' file.ext
```

note:<br>

- s = find and replace
- regexp = regular expresion
- replace = what to replace that regex with
- g = we wanna replace every single instance of the regex in the file

<br>
example:

```
>sed -i 's/,/ /g' test.txt
```

note:<br>
this is gonna replace every comma with a space in test.txt
but if you don't wanna change but just wanna output, then don't include the "-i"
<br>
you can write files using awk code
then execute that file because awk is a programming language
