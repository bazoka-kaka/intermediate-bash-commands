# awk Command

first you wanna create a file called "awk\-command"

inside awk\-command:

```
# This is a comment

BEGIN {
  FS=" ";
  OFS="\t\t";
  print "Date\t\tPrice\t\tVolume";
  print "----\t\t-----\t\t------";
};
{
  print $1, $2, $3;
};
```

you have variables that comes with awk.
<br>
note:
<br>

- BEGIN \-\-\> This is gonna happen before anything else
- FS \-\-> This is a separated for example: FS=" " this is saying that our file is separated by spaces
- OFS \-\-\> This is saying what we wanna separate our output with
- print \-\-\> This is gonna print then add a new line at the end of it

### executing the awk command

in your terminal:

```
> awk -f awk-command test.txt
```

note:<br>

- \-f \-\-\> This is specifying the file that we wanna pass on

<br>
we can skip a certain line of file
by adding a little keyword before the curly bracket. the bracket doesn't necessarily need the

```
# This is a comment

BEGIN {
  FS=" ";
  OFS="\t\t";
  print "Date\t\tPrice\t\tVolume";
  print "----\t\t-----\t\t------";
};
NR > 1 {
  print $1, $2, $3;
};
```

all awk [builtinVar]

note:<br>

- NR > 1 \-\-> this means that we're only gonna output all the lines that is greater than one
